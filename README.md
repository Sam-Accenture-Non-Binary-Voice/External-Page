# *Sam*, the Non-Binary TTS Voice

[Sam](https://bit.ly/36OjUbt) is a non-binary AI-based digital voice solution that can be embedded into any software solution to speak text in a human-sounding voice. Accenture Labs, Accenture's technology R&D function, created Sam in collaboration with Cereproc, a text-to-speech technology provider. By open-sourcing this voice we hope to encourage adoption and creation of others like it in the future, so that there will eventually be a diversity of non-binary voices out in the world.
