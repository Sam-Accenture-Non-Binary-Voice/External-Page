# Sam, the Non-Binary TTS Voice

[Sam](https://bit.ly/36OjUbt) is a non-binary text-to-speech (TTS) voice that can be embedded into any voice assistant software solution. [Accenture Labs](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/about/accenture-labs-index) created Sam in collaboration with [Cereproc](https://www.cereproc.com/). By open-sourcing the components that we used to create this voice, we hope to encourage adoption and creation of others like it in the future so that there will eventually be a diversity of non-binary voices out in the world.
